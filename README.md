# FRUITY NILA 
<sup>(Fruity Native Instruments Language Agent - MIDI script for FL Studio)</sup>

#### Written by Duwayne

**FRUITY NILA** provides comprehensive support for Native Instruments controllers, including the [M-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/), [A-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-a25-a49-a61), and [S-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-s88/) within [FL STUDIO](https://www.image-line.com/). By leveraging the Native Instruments Host Integration protocol, FRUITY NILA transforms your controller's functionality to emulate a connection with Ableton or Logic Pro X. Notably, this script operates independently of the Komplete Kontrol App or Plugin, and it does not interfere with their normal operation.

**Minimum Requirements: Komplete Kontrol v2.3.0 or higher, Firmware 0.3.9 or higher, and FL Studio 21 or higher.**
